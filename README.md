# RoadMaintenanceApp
## Overview 
This is the result of a challenge given to a group of junior software engineers in the CodeLab program by the partnership of [CodeSpace](https://www.codespace.co.za/programs/software-development/?matchtype=b&device=c&keyword=codespace%20academy&adgroupid=78286133238&utm_campaign=6451583985&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=CjwKCAjwzJmlBhBBEiwAEJyLuzD17herXDOZtqVYv6_z2nyJX6DM_uMKFVjRiBlGJxE97ULMhDOl8RoCUGYQAvD_BwE) and [Royal Impact](https://www.linkedin.com/company/royalximpact/?originalSubdomain=za). The group had to identify a problem in their community and design a solution that fits in their context. The solution had to include JavaScript code, thus the RoadMaintenanceApp web application.

This is a web application that allows users to create and manage their road maintenance plans. This web app aims to improve efficiency, and enhance communication between stakeholders involved in road maintenance projects.
